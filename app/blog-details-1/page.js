                        <p>
                          Did you know that liquidity across the US financial
                          markets hit rock bottom after the debt ceiling deal in
                          May 2023? The anticipated consequence of the banking
                          crisis has shaken investor confidence globally. So
                          much so that even the Bitcoin market lost liquidity to
                          levels worse than after the FTX collapse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This can be a challenging time for brokerages because
                          the loss of liquidity leads to market inefficiencies,
                          increased slippage, and thin order books. These
                          conditions make even the most experienced traders stay
                          away from the market. If trader activity declines, it
                          is bound to affect revenues for your brokerage.

                          The ray of hope in these turbulent times is that
                          retail traders are sitting on a cash pile of almost
                          $1.8 trillion. This is a result of rage selling,
                          driven by recessionary fears in 2022. Now that
                          recessionary fears appear to be on the decline and the
                          massive trading firepower that retail investors have,
                          individual trading and hedging are expected to drive
                          the markets in 2023. CW BANK’s investor survey
                          suggests that amid economic instability, defensive
                          strategies could play a major role in shaping trading
                          decisions. Therefore, traders are expected to rely
                          more on hedging and effectively diversifying their
                          portfolios to maintain profitability and mitigate
                          risks.

                      <h2>Hedging and Tight Spreads</h2>
                      <p>
                        Participating in the financial markets is inherently
                        risky. The risks increase when there is fear of slippage
                        due to lack of liquidity. Plus, costs rise when low
                        liquidity leads to wider spreads. This is especially
                        experienced by traders of minor or exotic forex pairs.
                        The problem is that steady liquidity with low forex
                        spreads is mostly accessible to institutional investors
                        with access to institutional-grade liquidity. For the
                        retail segment, such low spreads are available only for
                        a limited time when the forex sessions of the top global
                        markets overlap.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        
                        Market fluctuations, unexpected news, unfavorable
                        economic data, and internal updates from a country can
                        result in price gapping as a currency (or a pair)
                        becomes less liquid. This can lead to dissatisfying
                        experiences, leading to your clients losing enthusiasm.
                        Moreover, the OTC markets present a wide range of
                        bid-ask rates, while slippage throws spreads and
                        traders’ strategies off-balance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ultra-low spreads facilitate hedging at lower cost,
                        reducing the magnitude of potential losses.
                        Additionally, tight spreads reduce the risk of margin
                        calls or stopping out of hedging positions. Further, low
                        spreads might just motivate your clients to make the
                        most of more market opportunities. In other words,
                        improved hedging experiences enhance activity on your
                        brokerage platform, which boosts your revenues.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        More experienced market participants tend to seek
                        ultra-thin, and sometimes variable, spreads. This is
                        because variable forex spreads can at times be tighter
                        than fixed ones. On the other hand, there are times when
                        traders are unable to open too many positions or get
                        high execution speed with lower spreads.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Also, tighter spreads are critical for certain
                        strategies, such as scalping and other high-frequency
                        techniques. With the tightest spreads, some traders
                        might feel more comfortable using algorithmic and robo
                        trading. A brokerage may stand to lose a significant
                        customer base if it is unable to facilitate fast-paced
                        strategies due to wider spreads.

                    <p>
                      Did you know that acquiring a new customer can cost almost
                      7 times the expense of retaining an existing one? Plus,
                      long-term customers become your unpaid brand ambassadors,
                      who help acquire new ones! So, it is a win-win for a
                      brokerage to provide existing customers best-in-class
                      facilities.

                      Providing bespoke spreads across a wide range of financial
                      instruments can give your brokerage an edge over the
                      competition. Additionally, it disseminates the message
                      that you have access to deep liquidity, which in turn
                      helps improve customer acquisition.

                    <p>
                      Offering competitive spreads can be a differentiator in
                      the intensely competitive financial markets. But
                      collaborating with multiple institutions to facilitate
                      deep liquidity is tedious. This is because many liquidity
                      providers do not offer the same level of liquidity across
                      a wide range of financial instruments or jurisdictions.
                      Also, partnering with several institutions could add to
                      your operational costs, which may end up turning traders
                      off if you pass on the expenses to them.

                      Therefore, partnering with an experienced global liquidity
                      partner is essential. Leveraging the expertise and
                      experience of a trusted partner can allow you to focus
                      more on value-added service provision, such as improving
                      the customer experience and providing financial education
                      to empower your clients.

                      Two additional aspects that brokers should consider when
                      selecting a Liquidity Provider (LP) are NOP Limits and
                      Maximum Order Size.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt_20 mb_20">
                      NOP Limits are vital for brokers who hedge their net
                      exposures. They must be aware of these limits on the LP
                      side; otherwise, some orders might be rejected and the
                      additional exposure might not be accepted. Every LP
                      maintains different policies regarding NOP, so it’s
                      advisable for brokers to consult with their LP on this
                      matter before signing any agreement.

                    <p>
                      The second point is maximum order size. Liquidity
                      providers should not artificially limit the maximum order
                      sizes. The maximum order size should always be the result
                      of the available tickets in the order book. It allows the
                      clients to effectively hedge their exposures.

                    <p className="mb_20">
                      During economically turbulent times, many investors tend
                      to resort to shorting. But shorting requires deep
                      liquidity for ultra-fast execution. Slippage might defeat
                      the entire purpose of shorting.
